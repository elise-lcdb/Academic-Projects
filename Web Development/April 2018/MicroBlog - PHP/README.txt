Hello! 

There are just a few things that I want to let you know about my microblog.

1) There is a file called run-first.php. Like its name implies, this needs to be run first as this page creates the database and the tables. This only needs to be run once as the database and tables only need to be created once. There is also a direct link to the sign up page from there.

2) The posts are divided into two parts. The home.php page displays everyone's posts, while as profile.php only displays the user's code. The user also has the option to post a message form either the home.php page or the profile.php and it will show on both pages.

3)Both pages give the user the option to delete their own posts but not the posts of others.

<h1>MicroBlog</h1>
The goal of this project was to apply our skills in PHP and create a microblog that connects to a database.
<br>
There is a register and login page that stores the username and password in the database. The password is also hashed.
<br>
The blog allows for users to add comments, upload photos, and links. There is a page for all of the comments posted by all of the users in chronological order, and a page for the user's comments. The user can also delete their comments.
